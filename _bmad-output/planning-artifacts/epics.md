# terraform-google-secure-cicd - Epic Breakdown

## Overview

This document provides the complete epic and story breakdown for the native Antigravity CLI skill designed to deploy the `examples/mortgage-agent` example. It decomposes the requirements from the SPEC, PRD, and Architecture into implementable stories.

## Requirements Inventory

### Functional Requirements & Capabilities (from SPEC)

CAP-1: Guide through prerequisites (gcloud Auth, Org, Project, IAM, Domain, Org Policies). Success: runs gcloud auth, identifies missing Domain, halts on `restrictNonCmekServices` or `PERMISSION_DENIED`. (Derived from FR-1)
CAP-2: Gather `terraform.tfvars` interactively. Success: sanitizes inputs (trailing dot) and validates uniqueness of 6 GitHub URLs. (Derived from FR-2)
CAP-3: Review infra plan. Success: runs `init` and `plan`, writes output, pauses for explicit approval. (Derived from FR-3)
CAP-4: Seed CI repos and deploy ADK agent. Success: runs `apply`, templates manifests, copies service source and root-level `/build` policies/configs, pushes to `main`, executes ADK/IAM scripts. (Derived from FR-4)
CAP-5: Context-aware status reporting. Success: interrupts loop to report current/pending steps. (Derived from FR-5)

### NonFunctional Requirements

NFR-1: If the skill's execution is halted midway, running the skill again must safely resume the process. It must verify the current state (e.g., detecting if terraform state exists, checking if repos already have code) before re-executing steps to avoid errors or duplicated data.

### Additional Requirements

- The skill operates as an Agent-Driven Checkpoint Pipeline (sequential instructions in a runbook) and executes a read-only `check_state` function before executing any stage to natively satisfy idempotency.
- The skill MUST NOT use a local state file (AD-1) and MUST query the actual environment for the successful end-state.
- The skill MUST use the Agent's native shell tool to execute simple external cli commands directly, but MUST encapsulate long-running and complex operations into shell scripts (AD-2) and MUST use non-interactive automation flags (e.g., `terraform apply -auto-approve`) for any command that natively prompts for user input inside those scripts.
- If a tool or script returns a non-zero exit code, the Agent MUST natively pass both `stdout` and `stderr` to an LLM context to generate a diagnosis and remediation step, present it, and prompt for interactive retry (AD-3).
- Interactive shell commands (like `gcloud auth login`) MUST NOT capture output so the user can interact with the browser/terminal prompts. They must be treated as fail-fast validation checks where the Agent instructs the user to run them manually.
- Tool Execution convention: Use native Agent shell tools capable of capturing both stdout and stderr upon failure.
- User Prompts convention: Use standard Antigravity CLI prompt utilities (via chat) for yes/no and text input gathering.
- Stack requirements: Terraform <= 1.5.7, Git, envsubst, Google Cloud SDK.

### UX Design Requirements

None (CLI tool)

### FR Coverage Map

CAP-1: Epic 1 - Guide through prerequisites (gcloud Auth, Org, Project, IAM, Domain, Org Policies).
CAP-2: Epic 1 - Gather `terraform.tfvars` interactively with sanitization and validation.
CAP-3: Epic 2 - Review infra plan, write output, pause for explicit approval.
CAP-4: Epic 2 & Epic 3 - Epic 2 handles the `terraform apply`. Epic 3 handles the repo seeding, boundaries, ADK deployment, and IAM scripts.
CAP-5: Epic 3 - Context-aware status reporting via interruption.

## Epic List

### Epic 1: Interactive Configuration & Prerequisites
Users can interactively validate all GCP prerequisites, authenticate their local environment, and generate a sanitized, validated configuration for the deployment. This epic establishes the foundational **Checkpoint Pipeline** orchestrator (stateless tracking via Agent runbook) and the **Native AI-Assisted Error Remediation** loop required by the Architecture.
**Capabilities covered:** CAP-1, CAP-2

### Epic 2: Infrastructure Provisioning & Approval Gate
Users can safely review the proposed infrastructure changes and provision the core GCP resources with idempotency and AI-assisted error recovery. This epic includes capturing and returning the Terraform outputs necessary for downstream pipeline stages.
**Capabilities covered:** CAP-3, CAP-4 (Terraform apply portion)

### Epic 3: CI/CD Pipeline Seeding & Deployment Automation
Users can automatically seed the required CI repositories across directory boundaries (hydrating manifests with Terraform outputs), deploy the Reasoning Engine ADK agent, and query the execution status on demand.
**Capabilities covered:** CAP-4 (Git & ADK portion), CAP-5

## Epic 1: Interactive Configuration & Prerequisites

Users can interactively validate all GCP prerequisites, authenticate their local environment, and generate a sanitized, validated configuration for the deployment. This epic establishes the foundational Checkpoint Pipeline orchestrator (stateless tracking via Agent runbook) and the Native AI-Assisted Error Remediation loop required by the Architecture.

### Story 1.1: Core Pipeline Orchestrator & AI Remediation Loop

As a platform engineer,
I want a pipeline orchestrator that executes stages sequentially and diagnoses shell errors using AI,
So that the deployment is safely resumable and I get intelligent help if a command fails.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the skill is executed from the terminal
**When** the pipeline starts
**Then** the Agent must sequentially invoke registered stages via the runbook
**And** it must execute a `check_state` direct shell command before each stage to skip completed work

**Given** a stage executes a shell command or script
**When** the command returns a non-zero exit code
**Then** the Agent must natively capture both `stdout` and `stderr`
**And** pass the output to the LLM to generate a diagnosis
**And** prompt the user to interactively retry the stage (y/n)

### Story 1.2: Interactive Prerequisites & gcloud Authentication Check

As a platform engineer,
I want the skill to verify my GCP prerequisites and authenticate my gcloud CLI,
So that I don't fail later in the deployment due to missing permissions or configurations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the prerequisites stage begins
**When** the Agent checks `gcloud` authentication status directly
**Then** it must check this non-interactively
**And** pause and output the exact `gcloud auth login`, `config set project`, and `auth application-default login` instructions if authentication is missing, waiting for user confirmation in chat

**Given** the user is missing a Public Domain
**When** prompted
**Then** the Agent must output the exact Cloud Domains registration instructions

**Given** the organization policies are checked directly
**When** `constraints/gcp.restrictNonCmekServices` is enforced
**Then** the Agent must gracefully halt with an explanation
**And** gracefully handle `PERMISSION_DENIED` errors without crashing if the user lacks `policyViewer` roles

### Story 1.3: Interactive tfvars Configuration Gathering

As a platform engineer,
I want to be prompted for the required deployment variables and have them validated,
So that my `terraform.tfvars` is generated without formatting errors.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the configuration stage begins
**When** prompting the user for variables via chat
**Then** the Agent must automatically sanitize strict fields (e.g., ensuring `dns_zone_domain` has a trailing dot)

**Given** the user provides the 6 GitHub repository URLs
**When** the input is submitted
**Then** the Agent must validate that all 6 URLs are unique and correctly formatted before proceeding
**And** use native tools to write the final variables to `terraform.tfvars`

## Epic 2: Infrastructure Provisioning & Approval Gate

Users can safely review the proposed infrastructure changes and provision the core GCP resources with idempotency and AI-assisted error recovery. This epic includes capturing and returning the Terraform outputs necessary for downstream pipeline stages.

### Story 2.1: Terraform Plan & Interactive Approval Gate

As a platform engineer,
I want to review the exact infrastructure changes before they are applied,
So that I don't accidentally provision incorrect or destructive changes to my GCP project.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the configuration stage has completed successfully
**When** the terraform stage begins
**Then** the Agent must directly execute `terraform init` and `terraform plan`

**Given** the `terraform plan` completes successfully
**When** presenting the results to the user
**Then** the Agent must write the full plan output to a file artifact
**And** notify the user of the file's location
**And** pause execution to prompt for an explicit "yes/no" approval before proceeding

**Given** the user is prompted for approval
**When** the user inputs "no" or rejects the plan
**Then** the Agent must gracefully halt execution without throwing a fatal error
**And** leave the environment unchanged

### Story 2.2: Terraform Apply & Output Extraction

As a platform engineer,
I want the skill to automatically apply the approved infrastructure and pass the outputs to the next stage,
So that the CI/CD pipeline seeding has the correct dynamic values to template the manifests.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the user explicitly approves the terraform plan
**When** executing the apply
**Then** the Agent must invoke `scripts/01-terraform-apply.sh` to run `terraform apply -auto-approve` (using non-interactive flags inside the script to prevent LLM timeouts)

**Given** the terraform apply completes successfully
**When** finalizing the terraform stage
**Then** the Agent must extract the outputs (e.g., via `terraform output -json`) directly
**And** return/persist these values so downstream pipeline stages can consume them

## Epic 3: CI/CD Pipeline Seeding & Deployment Automation

Users can automatically seed the required CI repositories across directory boundaries (hydrating manifests with Terraform outputs), deploy the Reasoning Engine ADK agent, and query the execution status on demand.

### Story 3.1: CI Repository Seeding & Manifest Templating

As a platform engineer,
I want the skill to automatically template my manifests and push the correct files to my CI repositories,
So that I don't have to manually copy files across directories and run git commands for multiple services.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the terraform stage completes and provides outputs
**When** the repository seeding stage runs for a service (e.g., `legacy-dms`)
**Then** the Agent must invoke `scripts/02-git-ops-and-adk.sh` passing the terraform outputs as variables

**Given** the script is executing
**Then** the script must template the Cloud Run and Skaffold manifests using `envsubst` populated with the terraform outputs
**And** it must explicitly copy the service's source code (`src/<service>`), the templated `cloud_run/<service>.yaml`, and the `skaffold.yaml`
**And** it must explicitly copy `cloudbuild-ci.yaml` and the `policies/` directory from the repository's root `/build` directory into the staging folder

**Given** the staging folder is fully assembled
**When** the script executes the git push
**Then** the script must explicitly check out or create the `main` branch to avoid pushing to `master`
**And** push the commit to the correct CI repository URL gathered in the configuration stage
**And** it MUST NOT use the `--force` or `-f` flag during push, safely failing (and triggering native AI remediation) if the remote repository already contains conflicting code

### Story 3.2: Reasoning Engine ADK Deployment & IAM Config

As a platform engineer,
I want the skill to automatically deploy the ADK agent and configure IAM policies after my repos are seeded,
So that the Reasoning Engine is fully functional without manual script execution.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the CI repositories have been successfully seeded and pushed
**When** the ADK deployment stage begins
**Then** the `scripts/02-git-ops-and-adk.sh` script must execute the Python script to deploy the reasoning engine ADK agent
**And** execute the bash scripts to configure IAP IAM egress policies

### Story 3.3: Context-Aware Status Interruption

As a platform engineer,
I want to be able to ask the skill for its current status during a long deployment,
So that I know the skill hasn't hung and I can see how much work is left.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the Agent is executing a long-running script
**When** the user attempts to query status
**Then** the Agent must handle this gracefully via its native chat interface
**And** output the currently running pipeline step
**And** list all remaining pipeline steps that are still pending
**And** resume its execution seamlessly if the user chooses to continue
